  "long_description": "Description\n===========\n\nInstalls the Disco map-reduce framework using the default settings.\n\nRequirements\n============\n\nIt is possible that earlier versions of these cookbooks will work as well.\nThese are the versions with which I've tested the cookbook.\n\n* python >= 1.0.6\n* simple_iptables >= 0.1.0\n* build-essential >= 1.0.0\n\nPlatforms\n=========\n\nThe cookbook is tested and works on Debian 6.0 and later. It may also work\non other platforms, but the templates are set up for Debian SysV init-type\nsystems. Contributions to support other platforms are gladly welcomed.\n\nAttributes\n==========\n\n* `disco`\n    * `repository` - URL to Git repository with Disco source code to clone\n      and install. Default: \"https://github.com/discoproject/disco.git\"\n    * `revision` - Revision to check out from within the `repository`.\n      Default: \"0.4.2\" (tag)\n    * `checkout` - Directory to clone `repository` into. Default:\n      \"/usr/src/disco\"\n    * `user`, `group`: User and group to run Disco as. Cookbook assumes\n      that the user and group already exist. _Note: a default SSH\n      configuration will be generated for the user, as Disco requires\n      passwordless SSH key access between the master and slaves._ Default:\n      \"disco\" (for both)\n    * `slave_search`: A Chef search query which will identify nodes that are\n      configured to be Disco slaves. Default: \"recipes:disco\".\n* `erlang`\n    * `magic_cookie`: Value to use as an Erlang magic cookie. This value\n      must be the same on all Disco nodes (master and slaves). Default:\n      \"set_me_to_something_random\"\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nThe cookbook includes an SSH key pair -- note that since this is published\npublicly, deploying this keypair to a running, world-accessible cluster is\ninsecure! You should overwrite `files/default/id_rsa` and\n`files/default/id_rsa.pub` with a matching, private keypair and take steps\nto ensure that the private key is not publicly disclosed.\n\nThe cookbook has two recipes: `default` and `master`.\n\n`default` Recipe\n----------------\n\nThe `default` recipe clones and installs the Disco source. This recipe\nshould be used on Disco slave nodes.\n\n\n`master` Recipe\n---------------\n\nThe `master` recipe includes `default`, and configures and starts a Service\nfor running the Disco master node. This recipe additionally configures the\nDisco master via \"/usr/local/var/disco/disco_8989.config\", a JSON\nconfiguration file for the Disco cluster, based on a node search. It may\ntake several Chef runs for the search to stabilize, and the Disco master\nwill be restarted each time this templated file changes.\n\nChanges\n=======\n\n* 0.1.2 (May 25, 2012)\n    * Corrected an invalid `not_if`\n* 0.1.1 (May 25, 2012)\n    * Added warning about SSH keypair included in cookbook\n    * Fixed foodcritic warnings\n* 0.1.0 (May 12, 2012)\n    * Initial release\n\n",
